# OpenSphere ASM

WebAssembly and asm.js module for [OpenSphere](https://github.com/ngageoint/opensphere). Built with
[emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten).

These modules are primarily used to expose functions for the geodesic
direct/inverse problem, the rhumb direct/inverse problem, and MGRS conversions 
provided by the excellent
[GeographicLib](https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/) by Charles Karney.
The library includes a [partial JS port](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geographiclib)
for the geodesic calculations, but not for the others. Another plus from this
module is the increased performance over pure JS.

## Prerequisites

See [prerequisites for emscripten](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)

tl;dr: You need a working compiler chain, java, python, and git.

## Setup

1. Run `./dev-install.sh` to set up the emscripten environment. You can run this over and over to update the emscripten SDK and GeographicLib.
2. Run `npm install` to set up the tests

## Build

Run `npm run build` or `./build.sh`

The build is intended to be consumed by the [OpenSphere](https://github.com/ngageoint/opensphere)
web application. However, it is definitely possible to run similar `emcc` commands
to produce WebAssembly or asm.js for nodejs.

## Try it

Point a browser at `example.html` and hit the test button.

## Development

Good candidates for additions to the ASM module:

* More functions from GeographicLib as we need them
* Heavy computations which are run many times

Things to be careful of

* Watch the gzipped file size of the output. It is easy to explode it by adding libraries with many dependencies
